## Vlogs by Mahati

Over time, I've honed my video editing skills using software like iMovie and DaVinci Resolve, two powerful tools that have enabled me to experiment with a range of editing techniques. iMovie, with its user-friendly interface,  provided a solid foundation for me to start piecing together footage, adding transitions, and incorporating soundtracks. As I advanced, I moved on to DaVinci Resolve, a much more robust and professional-grade software, known for its high-level color grading, advanced effects, and precise audio control.

By using these platforms, I've been able to create not only movies but also vlogs, showcasing my ability to tell stories and connect with audiences through video. I’ve experimented with various aspects of video production—from planning and shooting the footage to fine-tuning pacing, color, and audio elements in post-production. The skills I've developed through this journey include mastering the timeline for smooth cuts, implementing creative transitions, and adding visual effects or filters to enhance storytelling.

For my vlogs, the focus may have been on capturing everyday moments (moments in my senior year of highschool, college moments, and more) but my editing likely brought it to life, turning raw footage into an engaging and polished narrative.
